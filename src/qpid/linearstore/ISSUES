LinearStore issues:

Store:
------

1. Overwrite identity: When recovering a previously used file, if the write boundary coincides with old record start,
   no way of discriminating old from new at boundary (used to use OWI).

2. Recycling files while in use not working, however, files are recovered to EFP during recovery. Must solve #1 first.

3. Checksum not implemented in record tail, not checked during read.

4. Rework qpid management parameters and controls.

Tests
-----

* No existing tests for linearstore:
** Basic broker-level tests for txn and non-txn recovery
** Store-level tests which check write boundary conditions
** Unit tests
** Basic performance tests

Tools
-----

* Store analysis and status
* Recovery/reading of message content

Code tidy-up
------------

* Remove old comments
* Use c++ cast templates instead of (xxx)y
* Member names: xxx_
* Add docs to classes
